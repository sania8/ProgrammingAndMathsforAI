# ProgrammingAndMathsforAI
The repository consists of implementing the two tasks of INM702 (Programming and maths for AI)
The two tasks were :
Task 1 : Implementation of neural network from sractch using numpy
Task 2 : Enhancing the existing base CNN architecture / building own CNN using PyTorch
The entire repository consists of the following files and to reproduce the code and re-run to get results the order below can be followed to run the files:
1. EDA&DataProcessing.ipynb : Which includes code for pre-processing the data and performing EDA
2. Task1-NN_Implementation.ipynb : It includes the code for implementign Neural Network from scratch (6 experiments have been performed to get the best parameters)
3. Task2_CNN.ipynb : This file includes the code to implement CNN, where I build my own CNN architecture in order to classify the audios as "normal" or "abnormal". (3 experiments were performed out of 1 performed bestand gave satisfactory results)
4. LeNet.ipynb : In order to compare the results of implemented CNN with the standard architecture(LeNet) we performed the trainign on LeNET architecture
5. requirements.txt : This file includes all the libraries and packages necessary for this project
